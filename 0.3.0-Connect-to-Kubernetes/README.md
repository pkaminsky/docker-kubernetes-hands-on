There's some different tools. I use k9s but I will go over how to use Lens.

> choco install lens

https://k8slens.dev/

Next you need to set up your k8s config file

On Linux this is stored at `~/.kube/config`

On windows it's in `%USERPROFILE%/.kube/config`

## Set it up

Now you can open lens and look around
